[00:11.00]Watching every motion
[00:14.00]In my foolish lover's game
[00:21.00]On this endless ocean
[00:23.00]Finally lovers know no shame
[03:11.00][01:31.00][00:31.00]Turning and returning
[03:13.00][01:33.00][00:33.00]To some secret place inside
[03:21.00][01:41.00][00:41.00]Watching in slow motion
[03:23.00][01:43.00][00:44.00]As you turn around and say
[03:29.00][01:50.00][02:29.00][00:50.00]Take my breath away
[01:11.00]Watching I keep waiting
[01:13.00]Still anticipating love
[01:21.00]Never hesitating
[01:23.00]To became the fated ones
[02:01.00]Through the hour glass I saw you
[02:05.00]In time you slipped away,
[02:11.00]When the mirror crashed I called you
[02:15.00]And turned to hear you say
[02:20.00]If only for today, I am unafraid
[02:51.00]Watching every motion
[02:53.00]In this foolish lover's game
[03:01.00]Haunted by the notion
[03:03.00]Somewhere there's a love in flames
